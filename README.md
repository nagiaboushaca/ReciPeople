# ReciPeople Project

This repository contains a boilerplate setup for spinning up 3 Docker containers: 
1. A MySQL 8 container for obvious reasons
1. A Python Flask container to implement a REST API
1. A Local AppSmith Server

## Overview of Project
Our app, ReciPeople, serves to unite the community of all those interested in recipes together. 
On our app you can follow users, like, comment on, and save posts, and view many posts and recipes.
We have two blueprints for two of our user personas, Brock and Josie. We included all the 
routes in their respective folders.
